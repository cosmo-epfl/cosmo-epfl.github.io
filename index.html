<h1> Code repositories for the Laboratory of Computational Science and Modelling at EPFL </h1>

<p> This page is just a stub. We are in the process of preparing a single access point for 
the scientific simulation and post-processing code that is being developed in our laboratory.</p>

<p> You can visit our <a href="http://cosmo.epfl.ch">homepage</a> to get an idea of the 
kind of research we do at COSMO, visit our <a href="github.com/epfl-cosmo">Github organization page</a>
to see the different open repositories that are available, or proceed to some project-specific pages:

<br/> <a href="http://epfl-cosmo.github.io/gle4md">GLE4MD</a>: Generalized Langevin Equation thermostats
for molecular dynamics. Also contains a few pages explaining i-PI, a Python interface for Path Integral Molecular Dynamics.

<br/> <a href="http://epfl-cosmo.github.io/sketchmap">Sketch-map</a>: Tools, tutorials and references
for non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques to understand the configuration space of complex
materials and molecules.
